# I can't see my GitHub organization / repository on the Add New App page

Most likely you did not grant access to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) when you authenticated with GitHub to access the organization \(or a repository owned by the organization\).

To fix this you should follow this guide: [Grant access to a GitHub Organization](https://github.com/OrganizationDummy/devcenter/tree/acf5f40e38b6dcf6fe62e839a4c04acb31fdebd2/faq/grant-access-to-github-organization/README.md).
