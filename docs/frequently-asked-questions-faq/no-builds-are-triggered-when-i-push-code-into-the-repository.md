# No builds are triggered when I push code into the repository

If no builds are triggered automatically when you push code into your repository, you should **make sure your webhook is properly set on the git hosting service you use \(GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...\)**.

You can find the webhook related setup and troubleshooting guides in the [Webhooks section of the DevCenter](https://github.com/OrganizationDummy/devcenter/tree/acf5f40e38b6dcf6fe62e839a4c04acb31fdebd2/webhooks/README.md).

If the webhook is present on the git hosting service, you should check the [Troubleshooting section of the Webhooks docs](https://github.com/OrganizationDummy/devcenter/tree/acf5f40e38b6dcf6fe62e839a4c04acb31fdebd2/webhooks/troubleshooting/README.md).
