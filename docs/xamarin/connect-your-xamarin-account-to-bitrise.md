A connected Xamarin account is required if you use Xamarin Components
for example, which requires Xamarin authentication.

To connect your Xamarin account to your Bitrise.io account,
open your [Account Settings page on bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview),
and click the toggle in the left sidebar where you see `Xamarin`.

Here you can type in your username and password.
Please note that **we won't store your username or password**,
we send an authentication request with these information to the Xamarin
server and store only the returned authentication token.

_If you'd want to remove the connection just turn off the toggle._


## Activating the Xamarin connection for an App on Bitrise.io
