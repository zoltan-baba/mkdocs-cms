# Trial after signing up

After you have created your account on Bitrise it will start with a **14-day trial** of the [Team plan](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing). This means that you can setup your application and start building it with all the benefits of the paying plan.

You can see the remaining time of your trial in the header.
